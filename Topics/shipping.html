<strong>Delivery Time</strong>
<ol>
    <li>We try to keep as many locks in stock as possible, however, when you get into custom items like Keyed Alike sets or Master Keyed systems, we will often have to have these manufactured when ordered. All in stock items will ship within 24 to 48 hours, while custom manufactured items will ship within 12 to 15 business days. If you are ordering locks that require manufacturing, you will be notified of the lead time. </li>
    <li>Our default shipping method is either FedEx
        Ground (commercial addresses) or FedEx Home Delivery (residential
        addresses). We also offer FedEx 2nd Day Air for when you need locks right away, however, keep in mind manufacturing times for custom items such as keyed alike locks.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, please
        note that delivery time is also based on "business" days.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Calculating Cost</strong></p>
<p>Shipping costs are
    calculated on the website automatically during Checkout based on the
    weight of the items you are purchasing and your location.<br />
